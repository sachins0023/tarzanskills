Master and Branch
In a team project, each individual works on their own branch and once the code is in working condition, the individual has to do a pull request to the manager who manages the master branch.
In this way, the code in the master branch is always executable without errors or unwanted results. If another branch wants to add their code, then the manager adds it to the master branch
provided it doesn't cause any discrepancy. If any problems are encountered, the manager could manage the editing or deletion of the branch.
