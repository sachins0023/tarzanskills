Master and Branch
In a team project, each individual works on their own branch and once the code is in working condition, the individual has to do a pull request to the manager who manages the master branch.
In this way, the code in the master branch is always executable without errors or unwanted results. If another branch wants to add their code, then the manager adds it to the master branch
provided it doesn't cause any discrepancy. If any problems are encountered, the manager could manage the editing or deletion of the branch.

After every work completion, the individual does a git pull to check whether their code is same as what the master has. If the master has some changes that the individual doesn't have, then
it is updated in the individual's file through git pull. If the master has an updated file for which the individual also made changes, then the individual has to incorporate the earlier
committed code in master into his update and make sure both the updates work.
