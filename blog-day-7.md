# Becoming a 10x Software Developer : The Journey continues - Day 5 and Day 6

September 10, 2019

Hello Everyone,

I request you to go through my previous blog to be up-to-date with my progress. However I will try my level best to keep things as simple and easy to understand without any prior research.

It's been a while since my last blog. The reason being, transition to a more practice based training approach. Over the last few days as we have gone further into basic Python programming, we have encountered various types of problems.

The last couple of days, we have mainly started with conditional statements and loops. We will go through somme of the important aspects introduced:

1. Flow control: It is the order in which a program's code executes. For the help of programming, certain regulations are given as condition statements, loops and function calls. These are part of the flow control and determine the flow of running of the code.
2. if ... else / if ... elif / if ... elif ... else: These are some of the fundamental conditional status. For 'if' and 'elif' conditions have to passed to run its body while 'else' doesn't need a specific condition to be passed
```
Syntax

if (condition):
    <body>
else:
    <body>
    
if (condition):
    <body>
elif (condition):
    <body>

if (condition):
    <body>
elif (condition):
    <body>
else:
    <body>
```
3. while and while ... else: They are loops that run until a certain condtion becomes false. Constant updation is required in the body of loop as it is necessary to save it from becoming an infinte loop.
```
Syntax

while (condition):
    <body>
    <conditional variable updation>
```
4. continue : It resets the Head to the statt of the loop.
5. break : It breaks you out of the loop
6. range() : range() outputs the range of values between two specific numbers.
```
Syntax

range(start,stop,step)

Ex. list(range(0,5)) = [0,1,2,3,4]
    list(range(5)) = [0,1,2,3,4]
    list(range(0,30,5)) = [0,5,10,15,20,25]
    list(range(5,0,-1)) = [5,4,3,2,1]
```
Note that step value has to be given in case of negative propogation and only integer entries are allowed as start, stop and step.

7. for : 'for' is a loop to transverse through the elements in a list
```
Syntax
for value in range(n):
    <body>
```

More and more problems were practiced as we approach the ending of basics to Python programming. Soon we will venture into advanced python programming.
